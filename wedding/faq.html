          <p class="question"><i>Q: Why are you getting married in Seattle?</i></p>
          <p>A: We love Seattle. We knew we didn't want to get married in Chicago and we also knew that no matter where we went, the majority of our guests would be travelling. We decided we'd rather have everyone travel to one of our favorites cities and have a chance to explore instead of doing it in Chicago or Arizona for convenience.</p>
          <p class="question"><i>Q: Who can I contact if I have questions on the day of the wedding?</i></p>
          <p>A: Questions can be directed to Tonya Irick or Georganna Meyer.</p>
          <p class="question"><i>Q: What happens if I miss the bus to the wedding?</i></p>
          <p>A: Take a cab!</p>
          <p class="question"><i>Q: Do I need to attend all of the events during the weekend?</i></p>
          <p>A: We would love your company for the whole weekend but we understand this is not feasible for everyone. Above all else, we want to celebrate with you on our wedding day. Everything else is just icing on the cake.</p>
          <p class="question"><i>Q: Unfortunately I can't attend the wedding but I still want to send a gift; what is the best way to do this?</i></p>
          <p>A: We would love any gifts to be redirected as donations to our preferred charities listed on our registry page; if you feel strongly about a gift, you can ship it directly to us at any time.</p>
          <p class="question"><i>Q: All of the room blocks are full. What do I do?</i></p>
          <p>A: Hotel 5 is a great choice and is only a five minute walk from Hotel Andra. If you're unable to find a room there, we have a small block at the Ace Hotel, about a 10 minute walk away from the Hotel Andra. Please call and ask for Amiee and mention the Karl Muth or Muth-Meyer room block. Fair warning; their lowest rate rooms have private sinks and vanity areas but bathrooms are down the hall. When you call, specify that you're looking for a Deluxe or Junior Deluxe room.</p>
          <p class="question"><i>Q: I really want to attend the wedding but am trying to do so on a budget; do you have suggestions for hotels with more reasonable rates?</i></p>
          <p>A: We have a small block at the Ace Hotel, about a 10 minute walk away from the Hotel Andra. Please call, ask for Amiee and mention the Karl Muth or Muth-Meyer room block. You'll want to let them know you'd like to book a Standard room. Fair warning: Standard rooms have private sinks and vanity areas but bathrooms are down the hall.</p>
